## The Herbarum (and its contents)

TODO: Replace real-world references with in-game lore

The Herbarum is the backbone of reasearch throught the mod. All your discoveries will be recorded in their respective page in the herbarum. If you are playing with the mod we do not recommend reading this part of the document as it may harm the gameplay experience of discovery intended to come with the mod.

#### Blue Orchid
*Phalaenopsis*

#### Allium
*Allium cepa*

#### Ancient Bone
*Os archaios*

> *Os archaios* refers to not only the fact that this is a very, very old bone, but also to the idea that it is unidentifiable in both bone structure and anatomical location of origin. In simple terms, the very existence of this bone is a mystery, and requires further study.

## Soup (or Stew or Chowder or Whatever it will be called)

### Overview
Golems get hungry, what do they like? Soup! These can be made from mixing almost any set of ingredients together in a heated cauldron. Depending on the ingredients used different golems will prefer it and some different benefits will be applied. These can only be discovered by using the plant parts and seeing the results at which point this will be written to that plant's Herbarum page for future use.


### Conents
Stewlings, Soup Pots, Huge Soup Pots, Ingredients, Step Stools

---

### Soup Pots

As described above soup pots can be made by heating a cauldron over some kind of heat source, say a campfire, magma or lava. This will begin to bring the liquid inside to a boiling point as well as show the cauldron becoming hot enough whith a red overlay as shown below. You can now add all the ingredients you want to the soup and collect it with bowls or pump it out with another mod

<img src=images/heated_cauldron.png/ alt="https://github.com/rabbitminers/druidry" width="200em" alt="">

A (not yet) complete list of ingredients, descriptions and effects can be found [here]()

### Stewlings
(The cutest whisk you'll ever meet)

<img src=images/soupling.png/ alt="https://github.com/rabbitminers/druidry" width="200em" alt="">

The stewling will help you automate cooking your, well... stews. They'll help carry around, stir and serve stews to your golems assuming they are provided with all the ingredients they need, a recipe and access to a heated cauldron.

**Potential names:**
- [x] Stewlings 
- [ ] Brothians
- [ ] Potables
- [ ] Simmerites
- [ ] Soupkins (*)
- [ ] Chowderlings

Summoning the stewling : TODO

---

### Stewling Step Stools

Stewlings are short chaps and might need a leg up to reach heated cauldrons so give them a step stool (? also availabe in  a stool design) and in other wood types

<img src=images/stool.png/ alt="https://github.com/rabbitminers/druidry" width="200em" alt="">

---

### Huge Soup Pots

By placing cauldrons next to one another they can be combined like so, to form a larger cauldron to produce more soup at once, this will also require more heat which can be sourced as shown before with campfires or with other blocks such as magma or lava beneath the cauldron. (They also need a [stepping stool](#stewling-step-stools) for stewlings to reach them)

<img src=images/huge_cauldron.png/ alt="https://github.com/rabbitminers/druidry" width="200em" alt="">


Perhaps these could also be used as troughs for animals aswell as for alchemy at varying tempratures by increasing the surface area of the cauldron

Also see the [Corrupted Cauldron](#corrupted-cauldron)

## Item Transport

### Overview

Item transport comes in many forms, aside from the original vanilla item movement techniques, multiple new methods will be included allowing for items to be pushed, pulled, attracted and carried completely automatically

---

### Tuff Golems

Tuff golems will help you move around items within your grove, they can either carry around a single item type in large quantities or throw smaller stacks of multiple item types either into a specified spot or towards another golem

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; gap: 3em">
    <img src=images/worry.png/ alt="https://github.com/rabbitminers/druidry" width="200em" alt="">
    <img src=images/anger.png/ alt="https://github.com/rabbitminers/druidry" width="200em" alt="">
</div>

You could also change their outfit by clicking on them with a different type of dye (not designed yet) aswell as this when carrying blocks they can either deposit them as items or place it down. 

Their eyebrows could indicate their status such as health, path finding status, quantity of items available etc.

---

## Farming

### Overview
Farming automation should not just be a one step job of placing a golem and go but should be more convenient to automate than in vanilla, if not more expensive but far far cuter

### The Mossy / Meadow Golem
(Name to be decided)

- [ ] Meadowkin 
- [ ] Blossomlings 
- [ ] Mossbeards 
- [ ] Meadowmen 
- [ ] Lichenheart

<img src=images/meadow_golem.png/ alt="https://github.com/rabbitminers/druidry" width="400em" alt="">

The meadow golem, once over farmland will occasionally sit down and sprinkle crops by spewing water out of their arms and spin. This will help accellerate the crop growth like bonemeal but slower.

This will also prevent the need for water sources in your farms making them just a little more efficient.

<img src=images/meadow_golem_sitting.png/ alt="https://github.com/rabbitminers/druidry" width="400em" alt="">

Make sure your golems have water to sprinkle otherwise they wont be able to help grow your crops. A lack of water can be indicated by the dried out look and the lack of water dripping from their arms.

(The straw is for visual effect)

<img src=images/dry_meadow_golem.png/ alt="https://github.com/rabbitminers/druidry" width="400em" alt="">

The harvest haversack will allow your golems to carry around crops and seeds to help pick and plant them. On a note of balancing only seeds and plantable crops can be added by the player to the sack and only harvested crops can ever be added and transported by the meadow golem, as to prevent the tuff golem from being overshadowed

<img src=images/harvest_sack.png/ alt="https://github.com/rabbitminers/druidry" width="400em" alt="">

The meadow golem is an extension of the mossy golem from Minecraft legends as seen [here](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/new-friends--the-golems-minecraft-legends) in a article from the minecraft blog

## The Grove

### Overview

The grove will be the heart of everything you do, the grove could be a player made structure dependant on the heart they choose to imbue. This heart like a beacon or a Conduit will require a structure around it however the grove should be far more dynamic as it aims to be a centerpiece of a players home. Depending on the heart different forms and materials could be used.

### Its effects on golems

Only within these groves (or with a staff) can your golems survive, aswell as allowing magic to flourish. Golem automation can be set up with nodes, placed by the player will be connected to the heart by roots (or some other form for other groves) allowing for highly flexible yet performant automation

##### Golems (Technical notes)

The grove network will also be responsible for distrubting "golem schedules", abstracted from the player these will organise the location and action of a golem specified by its type and summoning aswell as bringing it to and from the kitchen to be fed

---


## Staffs (and their spells)

Staffs could act as a piece of your grove that the player could carry around with them allowing for golems to follow and for the magical spells and properties of the grove to be harnessed by them.

---

### Crafting

Rather than in a grid perhaps a staff could be extracted from the tree a player creates from a grove in some sort of ritual or through carpentry helping to create a symbolic link to the grove carrying across its purity, its heart and its gods.

This would also allow for the knowledge and research of the grove to be carried across to the staff seamlessly. If  the grove where to be destroyed this "disenchant the staff", causing it to become unusable

---

### Spells

Spells would be learnt to the player but be individual to the type of staff and grove, for example in purer groves a spell that effects health would create a healing aura in the area helping you and your allies whereas a darker staff say from the deep dark would wither (or the deep dark equivilent) the surrounding area harming the surrounding enemies

---

#### Divine Invocation

This would allow the player to call apon their god(s) to aid them, either through some kind of attack or a sort of blessing, depending on the god, the player(s) allegiance to them and the purity of the player this would create unique effects (if you've ever played Hades think of [this](https://hades.fandom.com/wiki/Boons) system)

---

#### Paladin spell
*(A big ol shield)*
This would create a barrier around the user and allies within radius absorbing a few hits providing a short period for the player to heal during a fight at the cost of not being able to attack or move quickly during or for a short period after the spells activation

In darker groves these sheilds could be spiked causing damage to attackers at the cost of a portion of this health being taken from the player

---

#### Alchemical spells

Potions brewed by the player can be absorbed into the staff replacing their duration with a set of charges that can be used like splash or lingering potions either on allies or enemies

---

#### Necromancy

Originating in the deep dark, necromancy when learned by the player would allow for defeated enemeis to be raised from the ground with a tap of the staff to become allies to the player. However as this is sculk magic these re-born mobs will be blinded and must be given new targets by the player or they will turn on them as they cannot tell the difference

---

#### Soul Spells

Soul magic would be tied to the nether as detailed  in a concept [here](#-nether-lich-maybe-something-other-than-a-lich-would-be-better), This spell would be cast at a target rather than as an area of effect like some of the others detailed here. It would allow the caster to (temporarily) take control of the entity until they can no longer sustain the link at which point their soul would be returned and the entity would die as its was displaced in the process.

This could be balanced by managing the "cost" and skill required to cast the spell in accordance with the entities health or armor, etc. Essentially an entity like the ender dragon or other bosses would require near or full mastery in soul magic to control.

---

## Nether 

### ? Nether Lich (Maybe something other than a lich would be better)

A powerful druidic entity that has taken residence in the Nether. You could interact with the Lich to learn powerful but dark druidic magic and rituals, but must be wary of angering the entity without mastering your purer powers first.

Specialising in control of the souls of creatures, the player can learn from the lich to utilise the souls of mobs ?(and other players) to influence them and within items. Perhaps soul infused weaponary and control over individual mobs at a time.

### ? Soul Magic (Extension of the Nether Lich)

(Purely idea dump)

- Soul-infused weapons: Players can infuse their weapons with souls to increase their power and grant them special abilities. The type of soul used will determine the effect of the infusion.
- Soul magic: Players can learn and cast spells that manipulate the souls of themselves or others. For example, they could cast a spell that temporarily grants them extra souls to power their abilities, or a spell that weakens their enemies by draining their souls.
- Soul constructs: Players can craft constructs powered by souls that can perform various tasks for them, such as gathering resources or defending their base. The type of soul used will determine the abilities of the construct.
- Soul familiars: Players can summon and bond with a soul familiar, a creature that will follow them and grant them special abilities. The type of familiar available will depend on the type of souls the player has collected.

---

### Corrupted Cauldron (I like this one)

<img src=images/cauldron.png/ alt="https://github.com/rabbitminers/druidry" width="200em" alt="">

(Name needs some work) A naturally occurring, incredibly brittle, cauldron made of blackstone capable of handling the heat of soul fire but cracks under regular fire. Making it able to create unique potions, alloys or some special soups

Due to its brittleness the cauldron can only survive within the heat of the nether and will shatter if moved across to the overworld encouraging exploration and long term usage & habitation of the nether to players

---

### Wither Magic
(Concept by Eevneon)

The force of the wither. Also a bit sinister and is able to convert skeletons into wither skeletons, and inflict wither effect to any kind of mob. If we want to expand this we can also make some kind of way to convert land into withered land, where you have a low amount of chance to get withered.

## End
