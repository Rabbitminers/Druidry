## Soup (or Stew or Chowder or Whatever it will be called)

### Overview
Golems get hungry, what do they like? Soup! These can be made from mixing almost any set of ingredients together in a heated cauldron. Depending on the ingredients used different golems will prefer it and some different benefits will be applied. These can only be discovered by using the plant parts and seeing the results at which point this will be written to that plant's Herbarum page for future use.


### Conents
Stewlings, Soup Pots, Huge Soup Pots, Ingredients, Step Stools

---

### Soup Pots

As described above soup pots can be made by heating a cauldron over some kind of heat source, say a campfire, magma or lava. This will begin to bring the liquid inside to a boiling point as well as show the cauldron becoming hot enough whith a red overlay as shown below. You can now add all the ingredients you want to the soup and collect it with bowls or pump it out with another mod

<img src=images/heated_cauldron.png/ alt="https://github.com/rabbitminers/druidry" width="200em" alt="">

A (not yet) complete list of ingredients, descriptions and effects can be found [here]()

### Stewlings
(The cutest whisk you'll ever meet)

<img src=images/soupling.png/ alt="https://github.com/rabbitminers/druidry" width="200em" alt="">

The stewling will help you automate cooking your, well... stews. They'll help carry around, stir and serve stews to your golems assuming they are provided with all the ingredients they need, a recipe and access to a heated cauldron.

**Potential names:**
- [x] Stewlings 
- [ ] Brothians
- [ ] Potables
- [ ] Simmerites
- [ ] Soupkins (*)
- [ ] Chowderlings

Summoning the stewling : TODO

### Stewling Step Stools

Stewlings are short chaps and might need a leg up to reach heated cauldrons so give them a step stool (? also availabe in  a stool design) and in other wood types

<img src=images/stool.png/ alt="https://github.com/rabbitminers/druidry" width="200em" alt="">

---

### Huge Soup Pots

By placing cauldrons next to one another they can be combined like so, to form a larger cauldron to produce more soup at once, this will also require more heat which can be sourced as shown before with campfires or with other blocks such as magma or lava beneath the cauldron. (They also need a [stepping stool](#stewling-step-stools) for stewlings to reach them)

<img src=images/huge_cauldron.png/ alt="https://github.com/rabbitminers/druidry" width="200em" alt="">


Perhaps these could also be used as troughs for animals aswell as for alchemy at varying tempratures by increasing the surface area of the cauldron

Also see the [Corrupted Cauldron](#corrupted-cauldron)

## Item Transport

### Overview

Item transport comes in many forms, aside from the original vanilla item movement techniques, multiple new methods will be included allowing for items to be pushed, pulled, attracted and carried completely automatically

---

### Tuff Golems

Tuff golems will help you move around items within your grove, they can either carry around a single item type in large quantities or throw smaller stacks of multiple item types either into a specified spot or towards another golem

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; gap: 3em">
    <img src=images/worry.png/ alt="https://github.com/rabbitminers/druidry" width="200em" alt="">
    <img src=images/anger.png/ alt="https://github.com/rabbitminers/druidry" width="200em" alt="">
</div>

You could also change their outfit by clicking on them with a different type of dye (not designed yet) aswell as this when carrying blocks they can either deposit them as items or place it down. 

Their eyebrows could indicate their status such as health, path finding status, quantity of items available etc.

---

## The Grove

### Overview

The grove will be the heart of everything you do, the grove will be player made and centered around a  

## Nether 

### ? Nether Lich (Maybe something other than a lich would be better)

A powerful druidic entity that has taken residence in the Nether. You could interact with the Lich to learn powerful but dark druidic magic and rituals, but must be wary of angering the entity without mastering your purer powers first.

Specialising in control of the souls of creatures, the player can learn from the lich to utilise the souls of mobs ?(and other players) to influence them and within items. Perhaps soul infused weaponary and control over individual mobs at a time.

### ? Soul Magic (Extension of the Nether Lich)

(Purely idea dump)

- Soul-infused weapons: Players can infuse their weapons with souls to increase their power and grant them special abilities. The type of soul used will determine the effect of the infusion.
- Soul magic: Players can learn and cast spells that manipulate the souls of themselves or others. For example, they could cast a spell that temporarily grants them extra souls to power their abilities, or a spell that weakens their enemies by draining their souls.
- Soul constructs: Players can craft constructs powered by souls that can perform various tasks for them, such as gathering resources or defending their base. The type of soul used will determine the abilities of the construct.
- Soul familiars: Players can summon and bond with a soul familiar, a creature that will follow them and grant them special abilities. The type of familiar available will depend on the type of souls the player has collected.

---

### Corrupted Cauldron (I like this one)

<img src=images/cauldron.png/ alt="https://github.com/rabbitminers/druidry" width="200em" alt="">

(Name needs some work) A naturally occurring, incredibly brittle, cauldron made of blackstone capable of handling the heat of soul fire but cracks under regular fire. Making it able to create unique potions, alloys or some special soups

Due to its brittleness the cauldron can only survive within the heat of the nether and will shatter if moved across to the overworld encouraging exploration and long term usage & habitation of the nether to players

---

### Wither Magic
(Concept by Eevneon)

The force of the wither. Also a bit sinister and is able to convert skeletons into wither skeletons, and inflict wither effect to any kind of mob. If we want to expand this we can also make some kind of way to convert land into withered land, where you have a low amount of chance to get withered.
